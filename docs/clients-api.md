## Create Client Validation

`id`:
- Generated automatically
- Not included in CreateClientDto
`name`:
- Required
- Non-empty string


## Update Client Validation

name field is optional, but the provided field must satisfy its original validation rules 
Only the `name` field may be updated
empy body is currentely accepted but change nothing 

## Database Rules

PostgreSQL table is `clients`
TypeScript id maps to `client_id`
`client_id` is a generated primary key
name is `varchar NOT NULL`
Names are not unique because different clients may have the same name
DTO rejects "", while PostgreSQL’s NOT NULL specifically rejects null
